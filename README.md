ProSensia Python Internship – Day 1: Calculator Task 

This project is part of the ProSensia Python Internship – Day 1 and focuses on creating an interactive calculator using Python. The script collects the user's name and two numbers, validates inputs using a custom get_valid_float(prompt) function, performs arithmetic operations (➕ sum, ➖ difference, ✖️ product, ➗ division), and handles errors like invalid input or division by zero using try/except. Key features include:

🔹 User input with validation and retry loop

🔹 Typecasting to float with exception handling

🔹 Division protected against zero-division errors

🔹 Clean output formatted to two decimal places using f-strings

🔹 Reusable and beginner-friendly structure
